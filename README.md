# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
### Analysis Problem : Improve customer retention by identifying high value customers for a telecom company, identify possible churn risk and suggest a solution to reduce churn. Tools: Python and Power BI.
Exploratory analysis was carried out using Python to determing some variables that have a significant impact on the response variable (Customer Status: Churn, Stayed and Joined). Some statistical test: Z-test and Chi-square was utilized to determine these variables. Again analysis on some factors that have great impact on churn was carried out. Check out the explortory data analysis process using Python [here](https://github.com/aliyudachristian/Telecom-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb)

### Data Visualisation Report: Using Power BI
#### Analysis on Tenure by Month: Relationship Between Tenure in Months and Total Revenue.

Although this does not imply causation, as tenure in months increases, total revenue generated by the user or customer increases. So, next let us investigate this impact on churn and stayed customers. 

#### Analysis of Tenure in Months on Customer Status.

The image shows that as Tenure in months increase the possibility of user or customer staying also increase. So this only means that the longer a user stays, the more revenue they will generate and the less likely it will be for them to churn.

#### Type of Contract Given to Customers
Investigating further, it is paramount to understand the type of contract given, as this might give insight into why users stays longer than others.

As can be seen customers with two year contract, stay longer, generate the most revenue, and have lower tendency of leaving. 

#### Understanding Whether Location have an Impact on Churn Rate

Most of our customers is from North America, hence most of churned customers are from there. 

#### Customers by Payment Method 
![Telcom PDF_page-0005](https://github.com/aliyudachristian/Telecom-Churn-Analysis/assets/173598605/720a9fb8-ed26-47a9-a81b-64fa76b8f893)

This shows the payment method that have tendency of retaining or churning users. 

### Recommendations
- Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs - Since longer tenure correlates with increased revenue and lower churn rates, develop loyalty programs that reward long-term customers. This could include discounts, special offers, or exclusive services.
- Promote Long-term Contracts - Encourage customers to sign two-year contracts by offering incentives such as discounted rates, free premium services, or bundled packages. Clearly communicate the benefits of long-term contracts to new and existing customers.
- Targeted Retention Strategies - Focus retention efforts on customers with shorter tenure (less than a year) by providing personalized offers and proactive customer support. Implement early intervention strategies to address potential issues before they lead to churn.
- Location-Specific Campaigns - Since the majority of your customers (and churn) are from North America, tailor your marketing and customer service strategies to address the specific needs and preferences of this demographic. Consider region-specific promotions and support services.
- Offer flexible payment options and ensure the payment process is seamless and user-friendly. Educate customers about the benefits of automated and recurring payments to reduce churn associated with payment issues.
